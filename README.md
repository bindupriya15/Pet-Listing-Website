## Running the Application

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

1. **Create a Production Build:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will generate static files in the `build` directory.

## Deployment

Deploy the contents of the `build` directory to your preferred hosting service. 

- **Netlify:** Configure a `_redirects` file with the following rule:
  ```
  /*    /index.html   200
  ```

- **Vercel:** Use `vercel.json` for rewrites:
  ```json
  {
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
    ]
  }
  ```

- **GitHub Pages:** Set the `homepage` field in `package.json`:
  ```json
  "homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository-name"
  ```

## Error Handling

- **API Errors:** Handle API errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages.
- **Empty States:** Display appropriate messages when no pets are found.
- **Error Boundary:** Implement an `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display errors.
